# feedbackscript#

a pretty straightforward script that emulates the keyboard to fill out the feedback form form for you while you sip on some tea. works for the traditional matrix type form and i can't guarantee that itll work in the future.

1. Keyboard module required
2. after executing, go to the page and highlight the first column (the options should not be visible). from then on, the script should handle the rest.
